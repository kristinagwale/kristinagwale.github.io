Our project involves creating an interactive geomap that displays where rapper Drake's songs are listened to, as well as where they landed on the charts, using D3 library and topojson link for country information. Hovering over a country shows additional details. We faced challenges in getting the map and country information to display, which we solved by utilizing a Promise all function to read the information and downloading a world.topojson file. We also encountered issues with getting the mouse hover function to work, but we were able to debug and resolve the problem. To provide data about Drake's most popular songs worldwide, we created a CSV file. Overall, our interactive geomap provides an engaging and informative visualization of Drake's global popularity.
